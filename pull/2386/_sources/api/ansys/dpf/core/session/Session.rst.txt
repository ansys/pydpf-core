:class:`Session`
================


.. py:class:: ansys.dpf.core.session.Session(server=None)

   Create a class to manage server sessions and handle events like progress and logging.

   A class used to create a user session on the server, it allows to plan events
   call backs from the server: progress bar when workflows are running, logging...
   A session is started every time a ``'DpfServer'`` is created.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   Class available with server's version starting at 3.0.

Method detail
-------------

.. py:method:: add_workflow(workflow, identifier)

   Add a workflow to the session. It allows to follow the workflow's events while it's running.

   This method is automatically called when a workflow's output
   is requested.

   :param workflow:
   :type workflow: Workflow
   :param identifier: name given to the workflow
   :type identifier: str


.. py:method:: add_operator(operator, pin, identifier)

   Create a workflow made of the input operator and all its ancestors to the session.

   It allows to follow the workflow's events while it's running.
   This method is automatically called when an operator's output
   is requested and the property :func:`ansys.dpf.core.dpf_operator.Operator.progress_bar`
   is set to ``'True'``.

   :param operator:
   :type operator: Operator
   :param pin: output pin number requested
   :type pin: int
   :param identifier: name given to the workflow
   :type identifier: str


.. py:method:: handle_events_with_file_logger(file_path, verbosity_level=1)

   Add an event handler of type ``file_logger`` server side.

   Events will then be caught and forwarded to the file stream.

   :param file_path:
   :type file_path: str
   :param verbosity_level: 0, 1 or 2
   :type verbosity_level: int


.. py:method:: start_emitting_rpc_log()

   Add a signal emitter to the session. This emitter will catch all incoming rpc calls.

   Adding a handler will enable the logging (
   use :func:`Session.handle_events_with_file_logger()`).



.. py:method:: listen_to_progress()

   Start a progress bar and updates it every time an operator is finished.


.. py:method:: add_progress_system()

   Ask the session to start recording progress events.

   Called when the session is started.


.. py:method:: flush_workflows()

   Remove the handle on the workflow by the ``session``.


.. py:method:: delete()

   Clean up resources associated with the instance.

   This method calls the deleter function to release resources. If an exception
   occurs during deletion, a warning is issued.

   :raises Warning: If an exception occurs while attempting to delete resources.


.. py:method:: __del__()

   Clean up resources associated with the instance.
