:class:`BaseService`
====================


.. py:class:: ansys.dpf.core.core.BaseService(server=None, load_operators=True, timeout=5)

   The Base Service class allows to make generic requests to dpf's server.

   For example, information about the server can be requested,
   uploading/downloading file from and to the server can be done,
   new operators plugins can be loaded...
   Most of the request done by the BaseService class are wrapped by
   functions.

   :param server: Server with channel connected to the remote or local instance. When
                  ``None``, attempts to use the global server.
   :type server: server.DPFServer, optional
   :param timeout: Fails when a connection takes longer than ``timeout`` seconds
                   to initialize.
   :type timeout: float, optional
   :param load_operators: Automatically load the math operators
   :type load_operators: bool, optional

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Connect to an existing DPF server
   >>> from ansys.dpf import core as dpf
   >>> #server = dpf.connect_to_server(ip='127.0.0.1', port = 50054, as_global=False)
   >>> #base = dpf.BaseService(server=server)

Import detail
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from ansys.dpf.core.core import BaseService

Property detail
---------------

.. py:property:: server_info

   Send the request for server information and keep the info into a dictionary.

   :returns: **info** -- dictionary with "server_ip", "server_port", "server_process_id"
             "server_version" keys
   :rtype: dictionary




Method detail
-------------

.. py:method:: make_tmp_dir_server()

   Create a temporary folder server side. Only one temporary folder can be created by server instance.

   The folder will be deleted when the server is stopped.

   :returns: **path** -- path to the temporary dir
   :rtype: str


.. py:method:: load_library(file_path: str | pathlib.Path, name: str = None, symbol: str = 'LoadOperators', generate_operators: bool = False) -> str

   Dynamically load an operators library for dpf.core.

   Code containing this library's operators is generated in
   ansys.dpf.core.operators

   :param file_path: Path to the DPF plugin file holding a library of operators.
   :param name: Name to give the plugin once loaded. Defaults to the name of the library file.
   :param symbol: The name of the entrypoint of the plugin, which is the function recording the operators.
   :param generate_operators: Whether to generate the Python modules for the operators of the library.
                              This updates the ansys.dpf.core.operators package of the current installation.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Load the mesh operators for Windows (for Linux, just use
   'libmeshOperatorsCore.so' instead of 'meshOperatorsCore.dll')

   >>> from ansys.dpf import core as dpf
   >>> base = dpf.BaseService()
   >>> # base.load_library('meshOperatorsCore.dll', 'mesh_operators')


.. py:method:: apply_context(context)

   Define the settings that will be used to load DPF's plugins.

   A DPF xml file can be used to list the plugins and set up variables.

   :param context: The context allows to choose which capabilities are available server side.

.. py:method:: initialize_with_context(context)

   Define the settings that will be used to initialize DPF.

   A DPF xml file can be used to list the plugins and set up variables.
