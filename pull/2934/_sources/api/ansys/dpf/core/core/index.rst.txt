.. py:function:: load_library(filename: str | pathlib.Path, name: str = None, symbol: str = 'LoadOperators', server: ansys.dpf.core.AnyServerType = None, generate_operators: bool = False) -> str

   Load a DPF plugin (a binary library of operators).

   Set `generate_operators=True` to also make the operators available in the current
   installation of `ansys-dpf-core`.

   :param filename: Filename or path to the operator library.
   :param name: Name to give the plugin once loaded. Defaults to the name of the library file.
   :param symbol: The name of the entrypoint of the plugin, which is the function recording the operators.
   :param server: Server to load the plugin onto. Defaults to the global server.
   :param generate_operators: Whether to generate the Python modules for the operators of the library.
                              This updates the ansys.dpf.core.operators package of the current installation.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Load the mesh operators for Windows (for Linux, just use
   'libmeshOperatorsCore.so' instead of 'meshOperatorsCore.dll')

   >>> from ansys.dpf import core as dpf
   >>> # dpf.load_library('meshOperatorsCore.dll', 'mesh_operators')


.. py:function:: upload_file_in_tmp_folder(file_path, new_file_name=None, server=None)

   Upload a file from the client to a temporary server folder deleted on server shutdown.

   :param file_path: file path on the client side to upload
   :type file_path: str or os.PathLike
   :param new_file_name: name to give to the file server side,
                         if no name is specified, the same name as the input file is given
   :type new_file_name: str, optional
   :param server: Server with channel connected to the remote or local instance. When
                  ``None``, attempts to use the global server.
   :type server: server.DPFServer, optional

   :returns: **server_file_path** -- path generated server side
   :rtype: str

   .. rubric:: Notes

   Is not implemented for usage with type(server)=
   :class:`ansys.dpf.core.server_types.InProcessServer`.


.. py:function:: upload_files_in_folder(to_server_folder_path, client_folder_path, specific_extension=None, server=None)

   :param specific_extension (optional): copies only the files with the given extension
   :type specific_extension (optional): str
   :param server: Server with channel connected to the remote or local instance. When
