Distributed modal superposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example shows how distributed files can be read and expanded
on distributed processes. The modal basis (2 distributed files) is read
on 2 remote servers and the modal response reading and the expansion is
done on a third server.

To help understand this example the following diagram is provided. It shows
the operator chain used to compute the final result.

Configure the servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make a list of ip addresses and port numbers on which dpf servers are
started. Operator instances will be created on each of those servers to
address each a different result file.
In this example, we will post process an analysis distributed in 2 files,
we will consequently require 2 remote processes.
To make this example easier, we will start local servers here,
but we could get connected to any existing servers on the network.

Create the operators on the servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On each server we create two new operators, one for 'displacement' computations
and a 'mesh_provider' operator and then define their data sources. The displacement
and mesh_provider operators receive data from their respective data files on each server.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-71

        remote_displacement_operators.append(displacement)
        remote_mesh_operators.append(mesh)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-76

Create a local operators chain for expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following series of operators we merge the modal basis, the meshes, read
the modal response and expand the modal response with the modal basis.

    merge_fields = ops.utility.merge_fields_containers()
    merge_mesh = ops.utility.merge_meshes()

    ds = dpf.DataSources(base_path + r'/file_load_1.rfrq')
    response = ops.result.displacement(data_sources=ds)
    response.inputs.mesh(merge_mesh.outputs.merges_mesh)

    expansion = ops.math.modal_superposition(
        solution_in_modal_space=response,
