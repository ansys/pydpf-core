Distributed msup distributed modal response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example shows how distributed files can be read and expanded
on distributed processes. The modal basis (2 distributed files) is read
on 2 remote servers and the modal response (2 distributed files) reading and the expansion is
done on a third server.

Import dpf module and its examples files

Create the template workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
this workflow will provide the modal basis and the mesh for each domain

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-30

    template_workflow = dpf.Workflow()
    displacement = ops.result.displacement()
    mesh = ops.mesh.mesh_provider()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-33

Add the operators to the template workflow and name its inputs and outputs
Once workflow's inputs and outputs are named, they can be connected later on

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-39

.. code-block:: default

    template_workflow.add_operators([displacement])

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-49

Configure the servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make a list of ip addresses an port numbers on which dpf servers are
started. Workflows instances will be created on each of those servers to
address each a different result file.
In this example, we will post process an analysis distributed in 2 files,
we will consequently require 2 remote processes
To make this example easier, we will start local servers here,
but we could get connected to any existing servers on the network.

and expand the modal response with the modal basis
