Using DPF Through Docker
************************

You can run DPF within a container on any OS using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_.

Advantages of running DPF in a containerized environment, such 
as Docker or `Singularity <https://singularity.hpcng.org/>`_, include:

- Running in a consistent environment regardless of the host operating system
- Offering portability and ease of install
- Supporting large-scale cluster deployment using `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_
- Providing genuine application isolation through containerization

Installing the DPF Image
------------------------
Using your GitHub credentials, you can download the Docker image in the 
`DPF-Core GitHub <https://https://github.com/pyansys/DPF-Core>`_ repository.

If you have Docker installed, you can get started by authorizing Docker to 
access this repository using a GitHub personal access token with 
``packages read`` permissions. For more information, see 
<https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token>`_.

Save the token to a file:

.. code::

   echo XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX > GH_TOKEN.txt


This lets you send the token to Docker without leaving the token value
in your history.

Next, authorize Docker to access the repository:

.. code::

    GH_USERNAME=<my-github-username>
    cat GH_TOKEN.txt | docker login docker.pkg.github.com -u $GH_USERNAME --password-stdin


You can now launch DPF directly from Docker with a short script or
directly from the command line.

.. code::

   docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/dpf -p 50054:50054 docker.pkg.github.com/pyansys/dpf-core/dpf:v2021.1


Note that this command shares the current directory to the ``/dpf``
directory contained within the image.  This is necessary as the DPF
binary within the image must access the files within the image
itself.  Any files that you want to have DPF read must be placed in
the ``pwd``.  You can map other directories as needed, but these
directories must be mapped to the ``/dpf`` directory for the server to
see the files you want it to read.


Using the DPF Container from Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Normally ``ansys.dpf.core`` attempts to start the DPF server at the first 
usage of a DPF class.  If you do not have Ansys installed and simply want 
to use the Docker image, you can override this behavior by connecting to the 
DPF server on the port you mapped:

.. code:: python

   from ansys.dpf import core as dpf_core

   # uses 127.0.0.1 and port 50054 by default
   dpf_core.connect_to_server()
   

If you want to avoid having to run ``connect_to_server`` at the start of
every script, you can tell ``ansys.dpf.core`` to always attempt to
connect to DPF running within the Docker image by setting environment variables:

On Linux:

.. code::

   export DPF_START_SERVER=False
   export DPF_PORT=50054

On Windows:

.. code::

   set DPF_START_SERVER=False
   set DPF_PORT=50054


The environment variable ``DPF_PORT`` is the port exposed from the
DPF container. It should match the first value within the ``-p 50054:50054`` pair.

The environment variable ``DPF_START_SERVER`` tells ``ansys.dpf.core`` not to start an
instance but rather look for the service running at ``DPF_IP`` and
``DPF_PORT``.  If these environment variables are undefined, they
default to 127.0.0.1 and 50054 for ``DPF_IP`` and ``DPF_PORT``
respectively.
