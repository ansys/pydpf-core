=============
API Reference
=============
This section gives an overview of the API of several public DPF-Core
classes and functions.

This API reference contains two main sections.  The first is a
description of the classes and methods built on top of the basic
operators.  These classes are specific to the DPF-Core package and are
designed to simplify the workflow of loading and analyzing results.

The second section is a full reference of all the operator
descriptions.  These operators form the basis for which all data is
obtained from DPF.  See :ref:`ref_dpf_operators_reference` for a
searchable index of all operators and their descriptions.
