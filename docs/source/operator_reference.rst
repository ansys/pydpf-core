Operators
=========

DPF operators allow the manipulation and the transformation of simulation data.

From DPF Server for Ansys 2023 R2 onwards, the operators available in DPF will depend on the active
`ServerContext <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/api/ansys.dpf.core.server_context.html#servercontext>`_.

The available contexts are **Entry** and **Premium**. Click a section to discover the operators available in your context. 
For more information about **Entry** and **Premium** contexts use, see :ref:`user_guide_server_context`.
