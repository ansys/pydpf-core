Operators
=========

Starting with the DPF server for Ansys 2023 R2, operator availability is
determined by the active
`ServerContext <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/api/ansys.dpf.core.server_context.html#servercontext>`_.

The operator documentations for each context are listed below.

For a DPF server delivered with Ansys 2023 R1 and older,
the operators available will be present in the Premium documentation.
However, some operators present in the Premium documentation might
not be available for older server versions (having been released later).
