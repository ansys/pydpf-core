PyDPF-Core is a Python client API for easily accessing DPF (Data Processing Framework)
postprocessing capabilities. The ``ansys.dpf.core`` package makes highly efficient 
computation, customization, and remote postprocessing accessible in Python.

The purpose of this User Guide is:

 - To describe basic DPF concepts and terminology (``DPF concepts``).

 - To describe the most common DPF entities and how they can help you to access and modify solver data (``DPF Most used entities``).

 - To provide you simple ways to tackle the most common use cases (``How to``).

For more advanced API usage, refer to the :ref:`ref_api_section` section and to the :ref:`sphx_glr_examples` section.
