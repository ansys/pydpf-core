PyDPF-Core is a Python client API for accessing DPF (Data Processing Framework)
postprocessing capabilities. The ``ansys.dpf.core`` package makes highly efficient 
computation, customization, and remote postprocessing accessible in Python.

This section has the following goals:

 - Describe basic DPF concepts, including terminology.
 - Describe the most-used DPF entities and how they can help you to access and modify solver data.
 - Provide simple how-tos for tackling most common use cases.

Other sections of this guide include :ref:`ref_api_section`, :ref:`ref_dpf_operators_reference`,
and :ref:`sphx_glr_examples`.
