PyDPF-Core is a Python client API for easily accessing DPF (Data Processing Framework)
postprocessing capabilities. The ``ansys.dpf.core`` package makes highly efficient 
computation, customization, and remote postprocessing accessible in Python.

These sections describe the most common DPF entities:

- :ref:`user_guide_model` provides the model for accessing results and metadata from result files.
- :ref:`ref_user_guide_operators` provide the objects for creating and transforming data.
- :ref:`ref_user_guide_fields_container` provide the main simulation data container with fields.

Additionally, :ref:`user_guide_plotting` describes how to plot results via PyVista.
