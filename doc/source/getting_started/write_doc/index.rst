Documentation
-------------

The PyDPF-Core documentation plays a pivotal role in making the project more accessible and usable.
Clear and comprehensive documentation empowers users and developers to understand, implement, and
troubleshoot the project effectively. It minimizes barriers to entry, making it easier for newcomers
to get involved and for existing contributors to be more productive.

Good documentation also reduces the burden on maintainers, as it can answer common questions and
help prevent issues. By creating or improving documentation, you not only enhance the project’s quality but
also facilitate knowledge sharing and community growth, making your contribution invaluable for the project’s
long-term success.

Write documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Writing good documentation for a GitHub repository is crucial to ensure that
users and contributors can understand, use, and contribute to PyDPF-Core
effectively.

Here's a short summary of how to write good documentation:

#. **Use a consistent structure**: Organize your documentation with a clear and
   consistent structure. Use headings, subheadings, and a table of contents if
   necessary to help users navigate your documentation easily.

#. **Use Sphinx properly**: Sphinx has multiple features and directives. Before
   starting to write documentation, you should get familiar with it. For guidance,
   see these Sphinx and DocUtils topics: `Directives <sphinx_directives_>`_,
   `reStructuredText Primer <sphinx_basics_>`_ and
   `reStructuredText Directives <docutils_directives_>`_.

#. **Usage Examples**: Include real-world usage examples, code snippets, and
   explanations to demonstrate how users can make the most of PyDPF-Core.

#. **Document the API and code**: Thoroughly document each function, class, and method. Include
   parameter descriptions, return values, and usage examples. Follow the
   `numpydoc <numpydoc_>`_ convention for documenting code.

#. **Tutorials and guides**: Create tutorials or guides to help users achieve
   specific tasks or workflows with PyDPF-Core.

#. **Troubleshooting and FAQs**: Anticipate common issues and provide solutions
   in a troubleshooting section. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) can also be
   helpful for addressing common queries.

#. **Maintain and update**: Keep your documentation up to date as the project
   evolves. New features, changes, and bug fixes should be reflected in the
   documentation.

#. **Solicit Feedback**: Invite users and contributors to provide feedback on
   the documentation and be responsive to their suggestions and questions.

View documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Documentation for the latest stable release of PyDPF-Core is hosted at
`PyDPF-Core Documentation <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/>`_.

In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an option
for switching from viewing the documentation for the latest stable release
to viewing the documentation for the development version or previously
released versions.
