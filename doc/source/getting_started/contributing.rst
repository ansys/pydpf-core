.. _ref_contributing_answer_discussions:

Answer discussions

Answering discussions is an excellent way to contribute to PyDPF-Core, and it does not require
any setup, just a GitHub account. Engaging in discussions often requires a thorough grasp of
the project‚Äôs goals and challenges. Your contributions can help other users or contributors who may be
facing similar issues, making the repository more welcoming and inclusive. By providing answers or solutions,
you can directly contribute to the project‚Äôs success, maintain its health, and encourage a positive,
open source ecosystem.

To discover how you can help see the `PyDPF-Core Discussions page <pydpfcore_discussions_>`_.

.. _ref_contributing_post_issues:

Post issues
-----------

Posting issues in a repository allows you to voice concerns, suggest improvements, or report bugs, which can
lead to a more robust and user-friendly project. It also offers an opportunity for you to engage with the
project‚Äôs community, learn from others, and gain experience in issue tracking and collaboration.

For the repository, issues serve as a structured way to track and prioritize work, helping maintainers understand
the needs of users and guide the project‚Äôs development.

Use the `PyDPF-Core Issues page <pydpfcore_issues_>`_  to submit questions, report bugs, and request new features. When possible, use
these issue templates:

- üêû Bug, problem, or error: Fill a bug report here;
- üìñ Documentation issue: Modifications to the documentation only;
- üéì Adding an example: Proposing a new example for the library;
- üéì Adding an tutorial: Proposing a new tutorial for the library;
- üí° New feature: Enhancements to the code;
- If your issue does not fit into one of these categories create a blank issue.

.. _ref_contributing_develop_code:

Develop code
------------

You can help improve PyDPF-Core by fixing a bug. To do it, you must set up the repository on your local
machine as per the explanations in the :ref:`ref_write_code` section.


.. _ref_contributing_improve_doc:

Improve documentation
---------------------

The PyDPF-Core documentation plays a pivotal role in making the project more accessible and usable.
Clear and comprehensive documentation empowers users and developers to understand, implement, and
troubleshoot the project effectively. It minimizes barriers to entry, making it easier for newcomers
to get involved and for existing contributors to be more productive.

Good documentation also reduces the burden on maintainers, as it can answer common questions and
help prevent issues. By creating or improving documentation, you not only enhance the project‚Äôs quality but
also facilitate knowledge sharing and community growth, making your contribution invaluable for the project‚Äôs
long-term success.

To contribute on our current documentation go to the :ref:`ref_write_doc` section.
