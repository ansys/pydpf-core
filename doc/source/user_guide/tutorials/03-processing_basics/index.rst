Processing data basics
======================

Data Processing consists in a series of operations applied to data to achieve a goal. DPF enables
you to access and transform simulation data using customizable workflows.

There is an extensive catalog of operators with different kinds and complexity that can be used together.
We can globally categorize them in two groups:

- Operators that acts directly in the data, like the mathematical, filter and averaging ones.
- Operators that manipulate the DPF entities themselves, like the logical, sorting and components selection ones.

The tutorials in this section presents some possible applications of PyDPF-Core

If you are not familiarized with those concepts you can check our concepts section: :ref:`ref_concepts`

       This tutorial demonstrate a basic post-processing procedure
       using PyDPf-Core based on its usual main steps. The goal is to
       transform simulation data into output data that can be used to
       visualize and analyze simulation results.
