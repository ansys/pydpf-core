What you need to know
+++++++++++++++++++++

These tutorials go through the steps required to access, analyze,
and transform simulation data using  PyDPF-Core.

Tutorials are more substantive and complex than examples. They are designed to teach how to perform a task and understand
the underlying concepts, providing detailed explanations at each stage, whereas examples showcase end-to-end specific processes.

DPF interacts with data stored in DPF data structures.
These DPF data structures are generated automatically when reading data from results file (`ref_to_section`) but they can also be generated from scratch (`ref_to_section`) when no supported result file is available.

Overview
++++++++

There are four main steps to transform simulation data into output data that can
be used to visualize and analyze simulation results:

    :bdg-dark-line:`Define simulation data` :octicon:`arrow-right;1em` :bdg-dark-line:`Store input data in DPF` :octicon:`arrow-right;1em` :bdg-dark-line:`Transform available data` :octicon:`arrow-right;1em` :bdg-dark-line:`Extract data`

The following tutorials go through each of these steps. Each tutorial presents code snippets specific to each supported file format.

        .. grid-item-card:: I have one file
           :link: ref_tutorials_model
           :link-type: ref
           :text-align: center

           Import and open a single result file with PyDPF-Core.
