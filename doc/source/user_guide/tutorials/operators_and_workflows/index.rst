Process data with operators and workflows
=========================================

An operator is the main object used to create, transform, and stream data in DPF.

They can perform different modifications of the data: direct mathematical operations,
averaging on the mesh, changes in the model locations.... They can also be chained together
to create workflows for more complex operations and customizable results.

The tutorials in this section present how to create and use these operators and workflows in PyDPF-Core.

For more information on how to program with PyDPF-Core check the
:ref:`ref_tutorials_language_and_usage` tutorial.
