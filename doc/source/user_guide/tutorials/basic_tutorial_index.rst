==================
The basic tutorial
==================

This tutorial guides throughout the basic concepts and features of the PyDPF-Core tool.
It helps to have a Python interpreter for hands-on experience, but all code examples are
executed, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

For a complete description of all the objects and modules, see the :ref:`API reference <ref_api_section>` section.
