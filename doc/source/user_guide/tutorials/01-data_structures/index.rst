DPF data structures
===================

DPF uses two main data structures to handle data: Fields and Collections.
Therefore, it is important to be aware of how the data is
structured in those containers.

The data containers can be:

    - **Raw data storage structures**: Data arrays (a ``Field`` for example) or Data Maps (a ``DataTree`` for example)
    - **Collections**: a group of same labeled objects from one DPF raw data storage structure (a ``FieldsContainer`` for example, that is a group of ``Fields`` with the same label)

These tutorials explains how these structures work and how you can manipulate data within.
