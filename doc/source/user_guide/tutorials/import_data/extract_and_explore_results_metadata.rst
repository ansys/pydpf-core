.. |Field| replace:: :class:`Field<ansys.dpf.core.field.Field>`

When you extract a result from a result file DPF stores it in a |Field|.
This |Field| will then contain the metadata for the result it is associated with.

The metadata includes the location, the scoping, the shape of the data stored,
number of components, and units of the data.

This tutorial shows how to extract and explore results metadata extracted
from a result file.
