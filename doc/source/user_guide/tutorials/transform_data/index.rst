Transform data
==============

An operator is the main object that is used to create, transform, and stream data in DPF.

They can perform different modifications with the data: direct mathematical operations,
averaging in the mesh, changes in the model locations .... They can also be chained together
to create more complex operations and customizable results.

The tutorials in this section aims to explain how to transform and operate on data to obtain
the desired input by using the DPF operators with PyDPF-Core.

For more information on how to program with PyDPF-Core check the
:ref:`ref_tutorials_language_and_usage` tutorial.
