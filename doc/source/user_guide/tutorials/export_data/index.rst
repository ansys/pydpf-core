===========

Data in DPF can be exported to universal file formats, such as VTK, HDF5, and TXT files.
You can use it to generate TH-plots, screenshots, and animations or to create custom result
plots using the `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ packages.

These tutorials explains how to export data from your manipulations with PyDPF-Core.
