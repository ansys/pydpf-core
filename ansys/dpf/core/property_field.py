    This class is a field with integer values instead of double values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nentities: int
        Number of entities that the property field is to contain. The
        default is ``0``.
    nature: core.natures
        Nature of the property field, such as scalar or vector.
    location : str, optional
        Location of the property field. Options are ``"Nodal"`` or ``"Elemental"``.
        The default is ``"Nodal"``.
    property field : str, optional
        Name of the property field. The default is ``None``.
    server : server.DPFServer, optional
        Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance. The
        default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the global
