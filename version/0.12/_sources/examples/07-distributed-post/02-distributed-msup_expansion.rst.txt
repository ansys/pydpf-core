Distributed mode superposition (MSUP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to read and expand distributed files
on distributed processes. The modal basis (two distributed files) is read
on two remote servers. The modal response is then read and expanded on a
third server.

The following diagram helps you to understand this example. It shows the operator
chain that is used to compute the final result.

Configure the servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make a list of IP addresses and port numbers that DPF servers start and
listen on. Operator instances are created on each of these servers so that
each server can address a different result file.

This example postprocesses an analysis distributed in two files.
Consequently, it requires two remote processes.

To make it easier, this example starts local servers. However, you can
connect to any existing servers on your network.

Create operators on each server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On each server, create two operators, one for displacement computations
and one for providing the mesh. Then, define their data sources. Both the
displacement operator and mesh provider operator receive data from their
respective data files on each server.

Create a local operator chain for expansion
