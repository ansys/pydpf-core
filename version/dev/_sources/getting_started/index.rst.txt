Getting started
===============

The Data Processing Framework (DPF) provides numerical simulation users and engineers with a toolbox
for accessing and transforming simulation data. DPF can access data from Ansys solver
result files as well as from several neutral file formats. For more information, see :ref:`introduction`.

This **workflow-based** framework allows you to perform complex preprocessing and
postprocessing operations on large amounts of simulation data.

PyDPF-Core is a Python client API communicating with a **DPF Server**, either
through the network using gRPC or directly in the same process.
