.. py:function:: field_from_array(arr: list | numpy.ndarray, server: ansys.dpf.core.server_types.AnyServerType = None) -> ansys.dpf.core.Field

   Create a DPF vector or scalar field from a numpy array or a Python list.

   :param arr: Numpy array or Python list containing either 1 or 3 dimensions.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field constructed from the array.
   :rtype: field


.. py:function:: create_matrix_field(num_entities, num_lines, num_col, location: ansys.dpf.core.common.locations = locations.nodal, server: ansys.dpf.core.server_types.AnyServerType = None) -> ansys.dpf.core.Field

   Create a matrix :class:`ansys.dpf.core.Field`.

   This field contains entities that have a matrix format. This is a "reserve" mechanism,
   not a resize one. This means that you need to append data to grow the size of your field.

   :param num_entities: Number of entities to reserve.
   :param num_lines: Number of matrix line.
   :type num_lines: int
   :param num_col: Number of matrix columns.
   :type num_col: int
   :param location: Location of the field. Options are in :class:`locations <ansys.dpf.core.common.locations>`.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field of the requested format.
   :rtype: field

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Create a field containing 3 matrix entities of a col*lines = 2*5 size with
   a nodal location (default).

   >>> from ansys.dpf.core import fields_factory
   >>> field = fields_factory.create_matrix_field(3, 5, 2)


.. py:function:: create_3d_vector_field(num_entities, location: ansys.dpf.core.common.locations = locations.nodal, server: ansys.dpf.core.server_types.AnyServerType = None) -> ansys.dpf.core.Field

   Create a specific :class:`ansys.dpf.core.Field` with entities that have 3D vector format.

   This is a "reserve" mechanism, not a resize one. This means that you
   need to append data to grow the size of your field.

   :param num_entities: Number of entities to reserve
   :param location: Location of the field. Options are in :class:`locations <ansys.dpf.core.common.locations>`.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field of the requested format.
   :rtype: field

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Create a field containing 4 3D vector entities with a nodal location (default).

   >>> from ansys.dpf.core import fields_factory
   >>> field = fields_factory.create_3d_vector_field(4)


.. py:function:: create_tensor_field(num_entities, location: ansys.dpf.core.common.locations = locations.nodal, server: ansys.dpf.core.server_types.AnyServerType = None) -> ansys.dpf.core.Field

   Create a specific :class:`ansys.dpf.core.Field` with entities that have a 3*3 format.

   This is a "reserve" mechanism, not a resize one. This means that you
   need to append data to grow the size of your field.

   :param num_entities: Number of entities to reserve.
   :param location: Location of the field. Options are in :class:`locations <ansys.dpf.core.common.locations>`.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field in the requested format.
   :rtype: field

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Create a field containing 4 tensor entities with a nodal location (default).

   >>> from ansys.dpf.core import fields_factory
   >>> field = fields_factory.create_tensor_field(4)


.. py:function:: create_scalar_field(num_entities, location: ansys.dpf.core.common.locations = locations.nodal, server: ansys.dpf.core.server_types.AnyServerType = None) -> ansys.dpf.core.Field

   Create a specific `:class:`ansys.dpf.core.Field` with entities that are scalar.

   This is a "reserve" mechanism, not a resize one. This means that you
   need to append data to grow the size of your field.

   :param num_entities: Number of entities to reserve
   :param location: Location of the field. Options are in :class:`locations <ansys.dpf.core.common.locations>`.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field in the requested format.
   :rtype: field

   Create a field containing 4 scalars with a nodal location (default).

   >>> from ansys.dpf.core import fields_factory

   Create a specific `:class:`ansys.dpf.core.Field` with entities that have a vector format.

   This is a "reserve" mechanism, not a resize one. This means that you
   need to append data to grow the size of your field.

   :param num_entities: Number of entities to reserve.
   :param num_comp: Number of vector components.
   :param location: Location of the field. Options are in :class:`locations <ansys.dpf.core.common.locations>`.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field in the requested format.
   :rtype: field

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Create a field containing 3 vector entities of 5 components each with a
   nodal location (default).

   >>> from ansys.dpf.core import fields_factory
   >>> field = fields_factory.create_vector_field(3, 5)


.. py:function:: create_overall_field(value: float, nature: ansys.dpf.core.common.natures = natures.scalar, num_entities: int = 1, num_comp: int = 1, server: ansys.dpf.core.server_types.AnyServerType = None) -> ansys.dpf.core.Field

   Create a specific `:class:`ansys.dpf.core.Field` with entities that have an overall location.

   Regarding the nature of the entity contained in the field, we set the same value
   for all elements.

   :param value: Value of the entity
   :param nature: Nature of the field entity data. For example:

                  - :class:`ansys.dpf.core.natures.matrix`
                  - :class:`ansys.dpf.core.natures.scalar`
   :param num_entities: Number of entities to reserve.
   :param num_comp: Number of vector components.
   :param server: Server with the channel connected to the remote or local instance.
                  The default is ``None``, in which case an attempt is made to use the
                  global server.

   :returns: DPF field in the requested format.
   :rtype: field

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Create a field containing 10 scalar entities of 1 component each with an
   overall location (default). Same value (1.0) is set for all element of the field.

   >>> from ansys.dpf.core import fields_factory
   >>> field = fields_factory.create_overall_field(1.0, natures.scalar, 10, 1)
