    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="In multibody simulations, some nodes may be shared by the bodies at their interfaces, but the values of the results (for example stresses or strains) calculated at these nodes may differ between the bodies. This can cause discontinuous plots, given that a single node will have multiple values for a variable. To avoid this, you can average these results across the bodies of the model.">
