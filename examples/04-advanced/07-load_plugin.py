# Import DPF-Core:
from ansys.dpf import core as dpf


server = dpf.global_server()

###############################################################################
# Create a base service for loading a plugin:
if server.os == "posix":
    dpf.core.load_library("libAns.Dpf.Math.so", "math_operators")
else:
    dpf.core.load_library("Ans.Dpf.Math.dll", "math_operators")

# Math operators are now loaded and accessible in ``ansys.dpf.core.operators``:

from ansys.dpf.core import operators as ops

math_op = ops.math.fft_eval()
