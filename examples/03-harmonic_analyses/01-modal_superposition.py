Expand harmonic modal superposition with DPF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different types of linear dynamics expansions are implemented in DPF.
With modal superposition used in harmonic analysis, modal coefficients
are multiplied by mode shapes (of a previous modal analysis) to analyse
a structure under given boundary conditions in a range of frequencies.
Doing this expansion "on demand" in DPF instead of in the solver
reduces the size of the result files.

# Create data sources
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Create data sources with the mode shapes and the modal response.
# The expansion is recursive in DPF: first the modal response is read.
# Then, "upstream" mode shapes are found in the data sources, where they
# are read and expanded (mode shapes x modal response)

###############################################################################
# Compute displacements
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Once the ``add_upstream()`` method puts the recursivity in the data sources,
# in a harmonic, transient, or modal analysis, computing displacements with
# or without expansion has the exact same syntax.
