Compatibility
=============

Operating system
----------------

DPF supports Windows 10 and CentOS 7 and later. For
more information, see `Ansys Platform Support <https://www.ansys.com/solutions/solutions-by-role/it-professionals/platform-support>`_.

Client-server
-------------

The DPF server version depends on your installed Ansys version.
The following table shows client-server compatibility for supported
Ansys versions. With Ansys 2021 R2 and later, you can use PyDPF-Core
version 0.3.0 or later. With Ansys 2021 R1, you must use a PyDPF-Core 0.2
version.

As new features are developed, every attempt is made to ensure backward
compatibility from the client to the server.

The `ansys.grpc.dpf <https://pypi.org/project/ansys-grpc-dpf/>`_ package
should also be synchronized with the server version.

Updating Python environment
---------------------------

When moving from one Ansys release to another, you must update the ``ansys-dpf-core`` package and its dependencies.
To get the latest version of the ``ansys-dpf-core`` package, use this code:

.. code::
    
	pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ansys-dpf-core

To get a specific version of the ``ansys-dpf-core`` package, such as 0.7.0, use this code:

.. code::

    pip install --force-reinstall ansys-dpf-core==0.7.0

.. _target_environment_variable_with_dpf_section:

Environment variable
--------------------

The ``start_local_server``  method uses the ``Ans.Dpf.Grpc.bat`` file or
``Ans.Dpf.Grpc.sh`` file to start the server. Ensure that the ``AWP_ROOT{VER}``
environment variable is set to your installed Ansys version. For example, if Ansys
2022 R2 is installed, ensure that the ``AWP_ROOT222`` environment
variable is set to the path for this Ansys installation.
