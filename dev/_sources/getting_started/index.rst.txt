Getting started
===============

The Data Processing Framework (DPF) provides numerical simulation users and engineers with a toolbox
for accessing and transforming simulation data. DPF can access data from Ansys solver
result (RST) files as well as from several neutral file formats, including CSV, HDF5, and VTK.
This **workflow-based** framework allows you to perform complex preprocessing and
postprocessing operations on large amounts of simulation data.

PyDPF-Core is a Python client API communicating with a **DPF Server**, either
through the network using gRPC or directly in the same process.


Installing PyDPF-Core
---------------------

In a Python environment, run the following command to install PyDPF-Core:

.. code::

   pip install ansys-dpf-core

For more installation options, see :ref:`Installation section <installation>`.


Installing DPF Server
---------------------

#. DPF Server is packaged within the **Ansys Unified Installer** starting with Ansys 2021 R1.
   To use it, download the standard installation using your preferred distribution channel, 
   and install Ansys following the installer instructions. If you experience problems,
   see  :ref:`Environment variable section <target_environment_variable_with_dpf_section>`. For information on getting
   a licensed copy of Ansys, visit the `Ansys website <https://www.ansys.com/>`_.

#. DPF Server is available as a **standalone** package (independent of the Ansys installer) on the 
   `DPF Pre-Release page of the Ansys Customer Portal <https://download.ansys.com/Others/DPF%20Pre-Release>`_.
   As explained in :ref:`Ansys licensing section <target_to_ansys_license_mechanism>`,
   DPF Server is protected by an Ansys license mechanism. Once you have access to an
   Ansys license, install DPF Server:

.. card::

    * Download the ansys_dpf_server_win_v2023.2.pre0.zip or ansys_dpf_server_lin_v2023.2.pre0.zip
      file as appropriate.
    * Unzip the package and go to the root folder of the unzipped package
      (ansys_dpf_server_win_v2023.2.pre0 or ansys_dpf_server_lin_v2023.2.pre0).
    * In a Python environment, run the following command:

    .. code::

        pip install -e .

    * DPF Server is protected using the license terms specified in the
    `DPFPreviewLicenseAgreement <https://download.ansys.com/-/media/dpf/dpfpreviewlicenseagreement.ashx?la=en&hash=CCFB07AE38C638F0D43E50D877B5BC87356006C9>`_ file, which is available on the
    `DPF Pre-Release page of the Ansys Customer Portal <https://download.ansys.com/Others/DPF%20Pre-Release>`_. 
    To accept these terms, you must set the
    following environment variable:

    .. code::

        ANSYS_DPF_ACCEPT_LA=Y

For more information about the license terms, see the :ref:`DPF Preview License Agreement<target_to_license_terms>` 
section.

For installation methods that do not use pip, such as using **Docker containers**, see
:ref:`ref_getting_started_with_dpf_server`.


Use PyDPF-Core
--------------

In the same Python environment, run the following command to use PyDPF-Core:

.. code:: python

    >>> from ansys.dpf import core as dpf
    >>> from ansys.dpf.core import examples
    >>> model = dpf.Model(examples.download_crankshaft())
    >>> print(model)


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none
