DPF operators provide for manipulating and transforming simulation data.

From DPF Server for Ansys 2023 R2 and later, the operators available in DPF depend on the active
`ServerContext <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/api/ansys.dpf.core.server_context.html#servercontext>`_.

The available contexts are **Entry** and **Premium**. Click a section to discover the operators available in your context. 
For more information about using these two contexts, see :ref:`user_guide_server_context`.
